				<p>Lung cancer is the number one cause of death from cancer, both among women and among men, and lung cancer causes a much greater number of victims annually than colon cancer, prostate cancer, lymph node cancer, and breast cancer combined.</p>
				<p>However, most deaths from lung cancer can be prevented; Because smoking is responsible for nearly 90% of all lung cancer cases, the risk of developing lung cancer increases in a positive relationship with the number of years and the number of cigarettes smoked.</p>
				<p>Quitting smoking even after smoking for many years can reduce the risk of lung cancer significantly, and the risk of lung cancer can be reduced by avoiding exposure to other factors that cause lung cancer, such as: exposure to asbestos and radon gas, and passive smoking .</p>

			<section class="section2 pt-5" id="symptoms">
				<h3 class="pb-3">Cancer symptoms</h3>
				<p>Different people have different symptoms for lung cancer. Some people have symptoms related to the lungs. Some people whose lung cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasized) have symptoms specific to that part of the body. Some people just have general symptoms of not feeling well. Most people with lung cancer don’t have symptoms until the cancer is advanced. Lung cancer symptoms may include:</p>
				<ul>
				  <li>Coughing that gets worse or doesn’t go away.</li>
				  <li>Chest pain.</li>
				  <li>Shortness of breath.</li>
				  <li>Wheezing.</li>
				  <li>Coughing up blood.</li>
				  <li>Feeling very tired all the time.</li>
				  <li>Weight loss with no known cause.</li>

				<h3 class="pb-3">Lung Cancer risk factors and causes</h3>
				<p>A risk factor is anything that increases a person’s chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Different cancers have different risk factors. Some risk factors, like smoking, can be changed. Others, like a person’s age or family history, can’t be changed.

				But having a risk factor, or even several, does not mean that you will get the disease. And some people who get the disease may have few or no known risk factors.

				Several risk factors can make you more likely to develop lung cancer.  These factors are related to the risk of lung cancer in general. It’s possible that some of these might not apply to small cell lung cancer (SCLC).</p>

					<h4>How does a person get lung cancer?</h4>
					<p>In some types of cancer, the accumulation of these cells generates a cancerous tumor, but not all types of cancer produce cancerous tumors, for example, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects blood cells, bone marrow, lymphatic system, and spleen, but this type of cancer does not produce a tumor.</p>
					<p>The initial genetic aberration is only the beginning of the cancer development process, and researchers believe that the development of cancer requires a number of changes within the cell, including the following:</p>
					<div>
						<h5 class="my-3">1. A precipitating factor that leads to a genetic change</h5>
						<p>Sometimes a person may be born with a specific genetic deviation, while the genetic deviation may occur in others as a result of active forces within the body such as: hormones, viruses, and chronic infections.</p>
						<p>Genetic deviation can also occur as a result of active forces outside the body, such as: ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, or carcinogenic factors from cancer-causing chemicals (Carcinogen) present in the living environment.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="my-3">2. Rapid cell growth factor</h5>
						<p>Cofactors exploit genetic aberrations and changes caused by initiating factors, as cofactors make cells divide more rapidly and this can lead to cells accumulating as a carcinoma.</p>
						<p>And cofactors can be passed on through heredity, and they can form inside the body or they can reach from the outside and enter the body.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="my-3">3. An encouraging factor that makes the cancer more aggressive and helps it spread</h5>
						<p>Without encouraging factors, a cancerous tumor can remain benign and localized, but encouraging factors make the cancer more aggressive, increase the likelihood of cancer entering and destroying nearby tissues, and increasing the possibility of the cancer spreading to other organs throughout the body.</p>
						<p>As in the case of initiating and facilitating factors, so too the inducing factors can also be transmitted through heredity, or formed as a result of the effects of environmental factors.</p>
						<p>The genetic structure, the lifestyle and the environment in which we live can all form the basis for the formation of cancer or to complete its formation if it has started. Of people exposed to the same agent that can cause cancer.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="mt-5">
					<h4>risk factors</h4>
					<p>Factors known to increase the risk of developing cancer include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span>Age: </span>Cancer can take several decades to develop, which is why most people are diagnosed with cancer after the age of 55.</li>
						<li><span>Habits: </span>Certain lifestyles are known to increase the risk of developing cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Smoking: </span>People who smoke are more likely to develop lung cancer than others.</li>
						<li><span>Drinking alcohol: </span>People who drink alcohol are more likely to develop cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Excessive exposure to the sun: </span>Multiple sunburns accompanied by the appearance of a fluid-filled bubble that appears in the upper layers of the skin increases the risk of developing cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Family history: </span>Only about 10% of all cancer cases occur on a genetic basis. If cancer runs in the family, genetic abnormalities are very likely to be passed down through heredity.</li>
						<li><span>General health status: </span>Certain chronic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, can greatly increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Living environment: </span>The environment in which we live may contain harmful chemicals that can increase the risk of developing cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Chemicals: </span>such as those found at home or in the workplace such as: asbestos or benzene, as they can be factors that increase the risk of developing cancer.</li>

				<h3 class="pb-3">Lung Cancer complications</h3>
				<p>Cancer and cancer treatment may lead to the emergence of several complications, including the following:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Side effects of cancer treatment.</li>
					<li>Unusual responses from the immune system to cancer.</li>
					<li>Cancer outbreak.</li>
					<li>The recurrence of cancer after treatment.</li>

			<section class="section5 pt-5" id="diagnosis">
				<h3 class="pb-3">Lung Cancer diagnosis</h3>
				<p>Diagnosing cancer in its early stages provides the best chances of recovery from it, so if the patient feels suspicious symptoms, he should consult with his doctor about which of the tests is most appropriate for him to detect early cancer, as early detection of cancer may save the lives of some people with some types cancer</p>
				<p>The American Cancer Society recommends early detection of cancer for people with moderate risk factors for the following types of cancer:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span>Breast cancer: </span>is detected breast cancer for women aged 40 years and above.</li>
					<li><span>Cervical cancer: </span>Cervical cancer  is detected for women age 21 and older or three years after the first sexual intercourse .</li>
					<li><span>Colon cancer: </span>Colon cancer  is screened for men and women 50 years of age and older.</li>
					<li><span>Cancer of the prostate gland: </span>is detected gland cancer prostate for men from the age of 50 and above.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="pt-3">
					<h4>Tests needed to diagnose cancer</h4>
					<p>To diagnose cancer, your doctor may choose one or more early cancer screening tests, including:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Physical examination.</li>
						<li>Laboratory tests.</li>
						<li>Imaging examinations.</li>
						<li>biopsy;</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="bold">After the diagnosis of cancer, the doctor tries to determine the extent of the cancer or the stage of the cancer, and then the doctor decides about treatment methods or the prospects for recovery according to the classification and degree of cancer in the specific patient.</p>

			<section class="section6 pt-5" id="treatment">
				<h3 class="pb-3">Lung Cancer treatment</h3>
				<p>Cancer treatment consists of a variety of treatments, and cancer treatment options depend on several factors, such as: the type and stage of the cancer, the general health status, as well as the patient's own preferences.</p>
				<p>You can consult with your oncologist about the benefits and risks of each of the cancer treatment options to determine the best and most effective cancer treatment for each case.</p>
				<div class="pt-3">
					<h4>Cancer treatment goals</h4>
					<p>The application of cancer treatment is achieved by achieving multiple and different goals, including the following:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Treatment aimed at killing or removing cancer cells.</li>
						<li>Treatment aimed at destroying the remaining cancer cells.</li>
						<li>A treatment that aims to treat the side effects of cancer and its treatment.</li>
