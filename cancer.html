				<p>Cancer is a medical term that includes a wide range of diseases characterized by the abnormal growth of cells that divide uncontrollably and have the ability to penetrate tissues and destroy healthy tissues in the body, and is able to spread throughout the body.</p>
				<p>Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the Western world, but the odds of a cure for cancer are constantly improving in most types, due to advances in early cancer detection methods and cancer treatment options.</p>
				<p>Cancer stages are denoted by degrees, usually with Roman numerals I through IV, with a larger number indicating that the cancer is more advanced. In some cases, the stage of cancer is indicated using letters or verbal descriptions.</p>

				<h3 class="pb-3">Cancer symptoms</h3>
				<p>Symptoms of cancer vary from one case to another depending on the organ affected by cancer. Some general symptoms of cancer are attributed to him, but they are not specific to cancer alone, and include:</p>
				<ul class="px-5">
				  <li>exhaustion.</li>
				  <li>High temperature.</li>
				  <li>A lump or swelling that can be felt under the skin.</li>
				  <li>pain.</li>
				  <li>Changes in body weight, including an unintended increase or decrease in body weight.</li>
				  <li>Changes on the surface of the skin such as: the appearance of a yellow color, the appearance of dark areas or red spots in the skin, the appearance of wounds that do not heal, or changes in moles that were present on the skin.
				  Changes in bowel or bladder functioning patterns.</li>
				  <li>persistent cough</li>
				  <li>Hoarseness.</li>
				  <li>Difficulty swallowing.</li>

				<h3 class="pb-3">Cancer risk factors and causes</h3>
				<p class="px-4">Cancer is generated by a mutation in a chain of deoxyribonucleic acid - DNA found in cells. This chain in the human body contains a set of instructions prepared for the cells of the body that determine how to grow, develop and divide.</p>
				<p class="px-4">Healthy cells sometimes tend to make changes to their DNA, but they are still able to correct the bulk of these changes, but if you can't make these corrections, the distorted cells often die. </p>
				<p class="px-4">However, some of these deviations are not correctable, which leads to the growth of these cells and their transformation into cancerous cells, and these deviations can also prolong the life of some cells more than their average life, this phenomenon causes the accumulation of cancer cells.</p>
				<div class="text-center mt-5"><span>How does cancer spread in the body!</span></div>

				<div class="mt-5 mx-4">
					<h4>How does a person get cancer?</h4>
					<p class="px-4">In some types of cancer, the accumulation of these cells generates a cancerous tumor, but not all types of cancer produce cancerous tumors, for example, leukemia is a type of cancer that affects blood cells, bone marrow, lymphatic system, and spleen, but this type of cancer does not produce a tumor.</p>
					<p class="px-4">The initial genetic aberration is only the beginning of the cancer development process, and researchers believe that the development of cancer requires a number of changes within the cell, including the following:</p>
					<div>
						<h5 class="my-3">1. A precipitating factor that leads to a genetic change</h5>
						<p class="px-4">Sometimes a person may be born with a specific genetic deviation, while the genetic deviation may occur in others as a result of active forces within the body such as: hormones, viruses, and chronic infections.</p>
						<p class="px-4">Genetic deviation can also occur as a result of active forces outside the body, such as: ultraviolet (UV) rays from sunlight, or carcinogenic factors from cancer-causing chemicals (Carcinogen) present in the living environment.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="my-3">2. Rapid cell growth factor</h5>
						<p class="px-4">Cofactors exploit genetic aberrations and changes caused by initiating factors, as cofactors make cells divide more rapidly and this can lead to cells accumulating as a carcinoma.</p>
						<p class="px-4">And cofactors can be passed on through heredity, and they can form inside the body or they can reach from the outside and enter the body.</p>
					</div>
					<div>
						<h5 class="my-3">3. An encouraging factor that makes the cancer more aggressive and helps it spread</h5>
						<p class="px-4">Without encouraging factors, a cancerous tumor can remain benign and localized, but encouraging factors make the cancer more aggressive, increase the likelihood of cancer entering and destroying nearby tissues, and increasing the possibility of the cancer spreading to other organs throughout the body.</p>
						<p class="px-4">As in the case of initiating and facilitating factors, so too the inducing factors can also be transmitted through heredity, or formed as a result of the effects of environmental factors.</p>
						<p class="px-4">The genetic structure, the lifestyle and the environment in which we live can all form the basis for the formation of cancer or to complete its formation if it has started. Of people exposed to the same agent that can cause cancer.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="mt-5 mx-4">
					<h4>risk factors</h4>
					<p>Factors known to increase the risk of developing cancer include:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><span>Age: </span>Cancer can take several decades to develop, which is why most people are diagnosed with cancer after the age of 55.</li>
						<li><span>Habits: </span>Certain lifestyles are known to increase the risk of developing cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Smoking: </span>People who smoke are more likely to develop lung cancer than others.</li>
						<li><span>Drinking alcohol: </span>People who drink alcohol are more likely to develop cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Excessive exposure to the sun: </span>Multiple sunburns accompanied by the appearance of a fluid-filled bubble that appears in the upper layers of the skin increases the risk of developing cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Family history: </span>Only about 10% of all cancer cases occur on a genetic basis. If cancer runs in the family, genetic abnormalities are very likely to be passed down through heredity.</li>
						<li><span>General health status: </span>Certain chronic diseases, such as ulcerative colitis, can greatly increase the risk of developing certain types of cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Living environment: </span>The environment in which we live may contain harmful chemicals that can increase the risk of developing cancer.</li>
						<li><span>Chemicals: </span>such as those found at home or in the workplace such as: asbestos or benzene, as they can be factors that increase the risk of developing cancer.</li>

				<h3 class="pb-3 px-4">Cancer complications</h3>
				<p class="mx-5">Cancer and cancer treatment may lead to the emergence of several complications, including the following:</p>
				<ul class="mx-5">
					<li>Side effects of cancer treatment.</li>
					<li>Unusual responses from the immune system to cancer.</li>
					<li>Cancer outbreak.</li>
					<li>The recurrence of cancer after treatment.</li>

			<section class="section5 pt-5" id="diagnosis">
				<h3 class="pb-3 px-4">Cancer diagnosis</h3>
				<p class="px-5">Diagnosing cancer in its early stages provides the best chances of recovery from it, so if the patient feels suspicious symptoms, he should consult with his doctor about which of the tests is most appropriate for him to detect early cancer, as early detection of cancer may save the lives of some people with some types cancer</p>
				<p class="px-5">The American Cancer Society recommends early detection of cancer for people with moderate risk factors for the following types of cancer:</p>
				<ul class="px-5 mx-5">
					<li><span>Breast cancer: </span>is detected breast cancer for women aged 40 years and above.</li>
					<li><span>Cervical cancer: </span>Cervical cancer  is detected for women age 21 and older or three years after the first sexual intercourse .</li>
					<li><span>Colon cancer: </span>Colon cancer  is screened for men and women 50 years of age and older.</li>
					<li><span>Cancer of the prostate gland: </span>is detected gland cancer prostate for men from the age of 50 and above.</li>
				</ul>
				<div class="pt-3 px-4">
					<h4>Tests needed to diagnose cancer</h4>
					<p class="px-5">To diagnose cancer, your doctor may choose one or more early cancer screening tests, including:</p>
					<ul class="px-5 mx-5">
						<li>Physical examination.</li>
						<li>Laboratory tests.</li>
						<li>Imaging examinations.</li>
						<li>biopsy;</li>
					</ul>
					<p class="bold px-5">After the diagnosis of cancer, the doctor tries to determine the extent of the cancer or the stage of the cancer, and then the doctor decides about treatment methods or the prospects for recovery according to the classification and degree of cancer in the specific patient.</p>

			<section class="section6 pt-5" id="treatment">
				<h3 class="pb-3 px-4">Cancer treatment</h3>
				<p class="px-5">Cancer treatment consists of a variety of treatments, and cancer treatment options depend on several factors, such as: the type and stage of the cancer, the general health status, as well as the patient's own preferences.</p>
				<p class="px-5">You can consult with your oncologist about the benefits and risks of each of the cancer treatment options to determine the best and most effective cancer treatment for each case.</p>
				<div class="pt-3 px-4">
					<h4>Cancer treatment goals</h4>
					<p class="px-5">The application of cancer treatment is achieved by achieving multiple and different goals, including the following:</p>
					<ul class="px-5 mx-5">
						<li>Treatment aimed at killing or removing cancer cells.</li>
						<li>Treatment aimed at destroying the remaining cancer cells.</li>
						<li>A treatment that aims to treat the side effects of cancer and its treatment.</li>
